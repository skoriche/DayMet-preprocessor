## Processed Data Directory

This directory contains the final output data.


## - `timeseries_csv/`
This subdirectory contains the final, aggregated time-series data in CSV format.

## File Format
- One CSV file per sub-basin (e.g., `Bear_timeseries.csv`).
- The files are generated by the `2_data_preprocessing/process_daymet_data.py` script.

## CSV Structure
Each CSV file has the following structure:

- **Index Column**: The first column is the time index, representing the date for each row of data at a daily frequency.

- **Data Columns**: Each subsequent column corresponds to a climate variable (e.g., prcp, tmin, tmax). The values in these columns represent the daily spatial average of that variable across the entire sub-basin for that day.

This clean, tabular format is ready for direct use in time-series analysis and machine learning models.
